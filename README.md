# Asteroids Clone

A game in the style of the classic game "Asteroids", based on [assignment 2 for COMP4300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmzU_-zbE7o).

## Getting Started

This project relies only on [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to build.
Once installed, simply type `make run` to build the raylib library and the project.

NOTE: the library flags set in the included `Makefile` are set for Windows, and will need to be changed for [Linux](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux) or [MacOS](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux).
